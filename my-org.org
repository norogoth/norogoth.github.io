* Chet questions
    ** I am confused on how props work in React.
        - JTC I cannot assign an onClick property to directly assign how event will be handled?
        - Does the () => in line 6 prevent the function from running? Making it a reference instead?
    ** How do I retrieve useState attributes? I do not understand what problem it solves or why the following code is considered bad
        #+
            function Greet({ name }) {
             const message = `Hello, ${name}!`; // Calculates output

            // Bad!
            document.title = 'Greetings page'; // Side-effect!

            return <div>{message}</div>;       // Calculates output}
        #+

    ** I am having difficulty understanding useEffect.
    ** Why can you do 
        #+
              const [stepNumber, setStepNumber] = useState(0);
        #+
        That makes me feels like in some "useState" object, there is already a "stepNumber" attribute so we can deconstruct it.
